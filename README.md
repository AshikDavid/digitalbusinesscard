# Digital Business Card

This is a solo project I completed on Scrimba. The Digital Business Card is a simple, responsive web page designed to showcase personal information and contact details in a professional format.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clean Layout**: A minimalist design that focuses on essential information.
